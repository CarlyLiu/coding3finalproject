# Coding3 Final Project
### Aim
I've really thought long and hard about what topic to do for the final project of coding3.Finally,I want to putting a glasses on the cat in image: make it like this üòä ‚û°Ô∏è üòé

I think the main step to implement is 

1.tracking the cat eyes

ÔºàupdateÔºö1.use the cat face detector model to determine the area of the cat‚Äôs eyesÔºâ

2.put the images together

ÔºàupdateÔºö2.use in-painting with a diffusion model to replace the cat‚Äôs eyes with sunglassesÔºâ


### 1.Dataset
At the beginning, I chose the existing database of cat.

Cat DatasetÔºö[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/cat-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/cat-dataset)

Cat Face DetectionÔºö[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/cat-face-detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/cat-face-detection)

the coding of download dataset in kaggle

### 2.1 YOLO model dataset - Image Annotation
Very unfortunately,I got a kaggle dataset of the cat eye ,but it's the points annotation (the yolo model need boxes annotation

That means, I need to do ** manually ** label images:(, which also is a new experience for me, and really take me a long and boring time.

> after this ,i got a idea of ai for label images, We can let the annotation software perform machine learning during the annotation process to predict the annotation label position, which can reduce the annotation time to a certain extent and improve efficiency.

For good results label at least 300 images, so imanually label of cat eye 300+ images in trainning side and 40 images in test side.

after that, i need to convert the VoTT csv format to the YOLOv3 format.

take me long time to figure out the tutorial of this part which is run in terminal.

### 2.2 train YOLO model

adam recommend:
yes, that can also be combined:
You can use the cat face detector model to determine the area of the cat‚Äôs eyes
You can use in-painting with a diffusion model to replace the cat‚Äôs eyes with sunglasses
