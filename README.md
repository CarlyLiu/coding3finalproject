# Coding3 Final Project
I've really thought long and hard about what topic to do for the final project of coding3.Finally,I want to putting a glasses on the cat in image: make it like this 😊 ➡️ 😎

I think the way to implement is 

1.tracking the cat eyes

2.put the images together

adam recommend:
yes, that can also be combined:
You can use the cat face detector model to determine the area of the cat’s eyes
You can use in-painting with a diffusion model to replace the cat’s eyes with sunglasses
